There are apples falling down from the top of canvas and a basket staying on the ground. The player can control the basket and move it to the left or right by pressing the key on keyboard “left” or “right”. A number is displayed on the right upper corner of the canvas, and it records how many apple has been caught by the user in the basket. When 20 apple falls into a basket, the game is over and the winner wins the game.
